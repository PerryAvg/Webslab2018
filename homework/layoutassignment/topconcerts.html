<strong> Why it made my top three: </strong> Ultra is hands down my favorite experience of my young adult life. I am truly fortunate to go to a school like the University of Miami that allowed me to go to a festival like this with tons of my best friends. Each stage had a completely different atmosphere and it is honestly hard to pick a favorite, but the whole atmosphere is a unique, riveting experience that keeps me coming back each year.

<strong> Why it made my top three: </strong> Odesza’s live performance was like none other that I have seen. The visuals of the lights, smoke machines, live odesza drum line, and intimate fans made the experience one of a kind. It was a culmination of hearing my favorite songs and seeing a visual representation live in a small welcoming environment that made the experience unforgettable.

<strong> Location: </strong> Festival Pier, Philadelphia, PA
<br>
<br>
<strong> Date: </strong> August, 2015
<br>
<br>
<strong> Why it made my top three: </strong> Mad Decent was an amazing experience, because it was the first all EDM festival I have ever attended. It also featured acts such as Jack U, who do not perform together anymore, and Porter Robinson, who’s song “Sad Machine” is one of my all-time favorites. The festival was also the summer before coming to Miami in August, so it was kind of a last “hoorah” with a bunch of friends from high school before starting a new chapter at the U.
