                <h1>Welcome!</h1>
                <p>Welcome to Perry’s EDM Picks! On this website, you can expect to find a culmination of Perry’s favorite concerts and artists he has seen live over the past 5 years. The music industry is constantly in flux, with new sounds and genres constantly being created, pushing boundaries further and further. The festivals are getting better, from a production standpoint, including the lights, visuals, sound systems, etc., as well as the artists performing at these festivals worldwide.

                <br>
                <br> EDM is an extremely vast genre, because so many sub-genres have formed from the boom of computer music. The artists and concerts on my list are based in Philadelphia, my hometown, and Miami, where I currently live while I attend UM. I hope you enjoy my list of my favorites as much as I enjoyed being there.
